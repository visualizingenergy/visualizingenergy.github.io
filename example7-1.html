            Energy is useful to people when it provides a desired service such as preparing a meal, moving from one place to another, accessing information on the Internet, and making indoor space livable via heating, cooling, and illumination.  In other words, energy is useful when it supports human well-being.
            <br><br>
            This immediately leads to questions such as: what is well-being, how is it measured, and well-being for who? And how equitable is the current distribution of “well-being”? The elements of well-being vary from person to person, place to place, and culture to culture, but we share some basic needs and aspirations. From a favela in São Paulo to an affluent suburb of London, people share the same basic physical, emotional, and social elements of well-being

            Well-being is a multi-dimensional concept. It is important to understand that the consumption of material goods and services is just one component a person's perception of their well-being. People also desire connections with other people and with nature, physical security, a voice in the political process, and meaningful work and leisure time.
            <br><br>
            What is the connection between energy and well-being? Below I explore that question using three very different indicators of well-being: per capita GDP, self-reported life satisfaction, and the Human Development Index.
            </p>
            <h2>What is the connection between energy use and GDP?</h2>
            <p align="justify">
              Dividing a country’s GDP by its population is a common way to measure the average level of material affluence in that country. In general, affluence is positively correlated with energy use per capita. People in poor countries that are concentrated in Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia have low levels of affluence and low levels of energy use in per capita terms. Conversely, countries with high levels of affluence generally use more energy per person (United States, Canada, the EU, Japan, Australia, some oil-rich Middle East countries).
            </p>

Conversely, countries with high levels of affluence generally use more energy per person (United States, Canada, the EU, Japan, Australia, some oil-rich Middle East countries).
              <br><br>
              China uses the largest quantity of energy and is the most populous nation, and it has the second largest economy after the United States as measured by GDP. But when energy use and GDP are scaled by population, China ranks 55th out of 178 countries in terms energy use per person, and 77th in GDP per person.
              <br><br>
              The animation reveals an important phenomena of the past half century. A number of large, low income countries such as India and China experienced significant increases in affluence that were accompanied by increases in energy use per capita. Those countries move diagonally upwards in the visualization. On the other hand, high income countries in Europe exhibit much slower rates of growth in affluence, which generally occur with little or no increase in energy use per capita.
              <br><br>
               “Affluence is not destiny” when it comes to energy use per person. Denmark and Iceland have similar levels of affluence, but the average Dane uses 80 percent less energy than the average Icelander. The average Chinese and Irish use similar levels of energy, but Ireland’s GDP per capita is nearly six times that of China. One takeaway is that the consumption of goods and services is an important determinant of energy use, but other factors are also important. These include structure of the economy, geography and climate, lifestyle, public policy, among other factors.
               <br>
             </p>
             <h2>What is the connection between energy use self-reported life satisfaction?</h2>
             <p align="justify">
               Non-material aspects well-being or may not be correlated with GDP per capita. The United States ranks in the top 10 countries in terms of GDP per capita, but it ranks 40th in life expectancy and 47th in infant mortality; it has one of the highest rates of incarceration; and more than 100 countries have a more equitable distribution of income.
               <br><br>
               There are subjective ways to measure well-being. The Gallup World Poll uses what is known as the Cantril Ladder that based on a survey that asks people to rank their life satisfaction on a zero (low satisfaction) to 10 (high satisfaction) scale .The Cantril ladder thus reduces a person’s assumptions, perceptions, goals and values to a single number from 0 to 10. Country-wide surveys can produce a single score for the average person’s self-reported life satisfaction.
             </p>
             <iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~hclifford823/61.embed"></iframe>
             <br>
             <p align="justify">
               Very low levels of energy use per person (1 to 5 GJ per person) are associated with very low reported life satisfaction (3 to 4 on the Cantril Ladder). But relatively small increases in energy use produce big jumps in life satisfaction up to about 20 to 30 GJ per capita. After that level of energy use, life satisfaction continues to grow, but at an ever-slower rate. At very high levels of energy use, incremental increases in energy use do not produce any gains in life satisfaction. This is called “diminishing returns” to life satisfaction.
               <br><br>
               Consider the range of countries with very high scores on the Cantril Ladder (above 7). Costa Rica, in the United Kingdom, Australia, Luxenberg, and Canada have very similar life satisfaction scores (7.1 to 7.2), but their energy use per capita differs by a factor of 10. On average, a Costa Rican (Cantril score = 7.1) uses 47 GJ per year, while a Canadian (Cantril score = 7.2) uses 433 GJ per year. Clearly, a person does not have to consume energy at the rate of an American, an Australian, a Canadian, a person in a small, oil-rich nation in the Middle East, or a person in many affluent countries in Western Europe to be satisfied with one’s life.
               <br><br>
             </p>
             <h2>What is the connection between energy use and the Human Development Index?</h2>
             <p align="justify">
               In 1990 the United Nations Development Programme published is first version of the Human Development Index (HDI) to provide a measure that distinguishes economic growth (GDP/year) and affluence (GDP per capita) from overall well-being. The HDI focuses on three important ends of development: access to health, education, and goods. Specifically, the HDI is a composite indicator comprised of (i)  index of life expectancy, (ii) education (mean years of schooling completed and expected years of schooling upon entering the education system), and (iii) per capita income indicators. Each country is scored on a 0 to 1 scale reflecting a low to high level of development..

               Countries with low levels of human development (HDI < 0.5) use much less energy than countries with medium and high levels of development. Raising incomes and building robust education and healthcare systems requires energy. But note that at low levels of development, small increases in energy use per person can produce dramatic increases in the HDI. Play the animation and watch the countries in the bottom left of the chart. Note that over time, their level of development generally increases with small increases in energy use.  But diminishing returns eventually take hold. At medium and high levels of development, each additional unit of energy used per person produces smaller gains in the HDI. Once again, we observe that countries vary greatly in how effectively they convert energy into improvements in well-being. Malaysia and Costa Rica have identical HDI scores  (0.81), but the average Malaysian uses 2.8 times more energy than the average Costa Rican.
