					<h3>Example 3</h3>
          For millennia, the human population grew very slowly, probably about 0.04 percent per year through the eighteenth century. Population growth accelerated in the nineteenth century due to advances in health care, nutrition, and public sanitation. By 1800, the population was about 1 billion people. The rate of population growth rapidly accelerated in the 20th century, reaching about 2 percent per year in the 1960s. By 2020, the world population stood at 7.8 billion people
          <br>
          The population growth rate is falling dramatically, and now stands at about one percent per year. The dramatic decline in fertility is due to a variety of forces, including improved educational opportunities for women, lower child mortality, better access to contraception and family planning information, later age of marriage, and higher incomes. The United Nations makes forecasts of future population size based on assumptions about fertility rates and other demographic forces. It’s “medium variant” forecast puts the human population stabilizing at about 11 billion people by 2100.

            Every person requires two types of energy. The first is the metabolic energy we derive from the food we eat. A human adult today with moderate physical activity requires 1.5 to 5.0 GJ of food energy over the course of one year. Metabolic energy needs vary by gender, weight, age, lifestyle, physical activity, and other factors.

            The second type of energy we need is exosomatic energy. The prefix "exo" is Greek for "external" or "outside," while "somatic" refers to "body" or "bodily." Thus, exosomatic energy is energy we obtain from nature and use to provide energy services (cooking, lighting, etc.).

            Just how much energy do we use other than food? That depends on the quantity and type of energy services we use. Our ancestors in the late Paleolithic era (circa 15,000 years ago) used about 2 GJ per person per year in the form of fuelwood to cook meat and provide warmth. By 1850, average global primary energy consumption was about 20 GJ per person, including fuelwood, wind, flowing water, fodder for draft animals, and coal. In 2020, average per capita use in the world was about 76 GJ per capita, predominately in the form of fossil fuels.

            At a very basic level, more people mean more energy to supply them with energy services. Countries with large populations (Brazil, United States, China, India) use more energy compared to countries with small populations (Iceland, Nauru, Botswana, Belize)  This suggests that if population continues to rise as the United Nations projects, more energy will be needed to support that larger population.

            But “demography is not destiny” when it comes to energy use. Consider the case of Canada and Uganda. Their populations are very close in total size, but Canada uses 167 times more energy than Uganda. Similarly, Qatar and the Philippines use roughly the same amount of energy, but the population of the Philippines is 38 times larger than Qatar (note that Figure 4.2 is a log-log plot, so small changes along each axis represent large changes in population and energy use).

            The data clearly reveal large differences in per capita energy use. The average Qatarian uses more than 700 GJ of energy each year; the average Filipino uses just 19 GJ per year. Clearly, there are other strong forces at work other than population size that determine how much energy a country uses.
