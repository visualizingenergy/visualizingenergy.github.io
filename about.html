					<h1 align ='center'>About Visualizing Energy</h1>
          <h3>Our mission</h3>
            <p>
              Visualizing Energy communicates facts on the link between sustainable energy and human well-being
               to decision makers, media, companies, advocates, educators, and the public.
            </p>
          <h3>Who we are</h3>
            <p>
              Visualizing Energy is an independent and neutral university-based research and communication organization.
            </p>
          <h3>What we do</h3>
          <p>
            We knit data analysis, visualizations, and the written word into stories that reveal how our
            energy system can be transformed to reduce inequity, steer humanity from climate disaster,
            improve health and other social outcomes, and lead to healthier natural systems. We address
            the energy system itself (sources, conversion, end use), economics (prices, investment, market
            failures), social outcomes (well-being, energy poverty, and climate justice), and environmental
            change (climate, pollution, and land and water use).
          <h3>How are we different</h3>
          <p>
            The internet is awash in information about energy, climate change, and health impacts of
            pollution. But society is deficient in a shared understanding of how our energy system must
            change. One reason for that is that information is siloed by technology, policy, and disciplines.
            We use the unique role of energy in human affairs and natural systems as the unifying principle
            behind compelling, data-driven stories that point to solutions that are feasible, affordable, and
            equitable. We are interdisciplinary and collaborative, working with diverse teams and
            perspectives that span the broad energy landscape.
          </p>
          <h3>Open access</h3>
          <p>
            Visualizing Energy aims to accelerate a sustainable energy transition by deploying a more
            equitable system of knowledge. To that end, all the data, visualizations, and original text are
            freely available to all users. We license all our content under the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons BY license</a>.
            Users have permission to use, distribute, and reproduce the data, visualizations, and articles
            provided the source and authors are credited.
          </p>
          <h3>Transparency</h3>
          <p>
            We heavily rely on data that someone else produced. All the data in Visualizing Energy is
            attributed to its original source so that the user can independently judge its accuracy and
            reliability. We describe all major modifications that we make to data.

          <h2 align='center'>Our Values</h2><br>
          <p>
          <b>Science leads.</b> The data and knowledge generated by scientific investigation is the
          cornerstone of our work. This includes the social, data, and health sciences, and their
          related professions. We recognize that the humanities bring an indispensable perspective
          to the energy and climate challenge.<br><br>
          <b>Neutrality.</b> We are neutral regarding technology and policy. The outcome of rigorous and
          impartial investigation guides the questions we ask, the content we present, and the
          conclusions that we draw.<br><br>
          <b>Independence.</b> Independence is a foundation of reliability. We are vigilant in maintaining a
          firewall between our work and external special interests, whatever their orientation.<br><br>
          <b>Communication.</b> We prioritize making knowledge accessible, clear, and actionable to a
          broad audience.<br><br>
          <b>Equity.</b> We are committed to an equitable energy system in which every person has access
          to clean, affordable energy services regardless of race, ethnicity, age, income, language, or
          class.<br><br>
          <b>Interdisciplinary collaboration.</b> We work with people, data, and methods that span
          academic disciplines and multiple ways of knowing.</p>

          <h2 align = 'center'>Equity</h2>
            <br><p>
              Our energy system is a taproot of inequity. Infrastructure such as pipelines, refineries, and power
              plants are frequently located near vulnerable and historically disadvantaged communities. Those
              communities endure greater exposure to the pollution and environmental degradation caused by
              the extraction, processing, and use of energy. Fossil fuels are the root of climate change whose
              impacts exacerbate every form of inequity. At the same time, vulnerable populations are cut off
              from the benefits of societyâ€™s use of energy, such as meaningful and well paid work, access to
              clean air and water, and access to clean, affordable energy services.
              <br><br>
              In high income nations, socially vulnerable populations struggle to pay utility bills, keep warm in
              the winter and cool in the summer, and they often lack access to energy-efficient housing and
              transportation. In low income nations, reliance on traditional sources of energy places a
              disproportionate burden on women and is a major source of indoor air pollution. In all countries,
              socially vulnerable populations lack access to the decision making process that determines the
              source, composition, distribution, and cost of energy services.
              <br><br>
              Visualizing Energy is committed to an equitable energy system in which every person has access
              to clean, affordable energy services regardless of race, ethnicity, age, income, language, or class.
              We commit to the examination and reporting of the inequities associated with our current energy
              system and how the ongoing energy transition can reverse inequity through intentional thought
              and action. We pledge to build the capacity to share our work with affected populations in ways
              that bring about meaningful change.
