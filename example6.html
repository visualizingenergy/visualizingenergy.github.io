            The modern oil industry was born in the mid 19th century in the United States in western Pennsylvania, and at the same time in today’s Russia due its control in the Caucasus (an area mainly comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and parts of Southern Russia). Early major products were illuminating oil in the United States and so-called “white oil” in Russia, a lubricating oil like Vaseline that is still important in the manufacture of baby oil, laxatives, perfumes, and plastics. Those countries remain major oil producers to this day.
            <br><br>
            Iraq and Kuwait with the first Middle east countries to launch an oil export business in the years immediately after World War II. Significant production began in Saudi Arabia and Iran in the 1960s. Production from most Middle East nations was launched via cooperative agreements foreign oil companies such as Chevron , BP, Shell, Standard Oil, among many others.
            <br><br>
            Note that some of the early leaders in oil production (Peru, Romania, India) quickly became minor players on the global stage after massive new discoveries in Mexico, Venezuela, Indonesia, and the Middle East. China started to develop a modern oil and gas industry in the 1950s. It was a net exporter of until the 1990s when surging domestic demand flipped the country to net import status.

          <br>
          <p align="justify">
            Annual rates of oil production are influenced by new discoveries; technological advances in the industry; politics; violent conflict; and changes in demand due to population growth, affluence, and the business cycle. Two recent technological advances stand out. The first was improved methods of mining, extraction, and upgrading of bitumen (“oil sands”) in Alberta, Canada that spurred major production increases beginning in the 1990s. The second innovation is the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) in the United States that reversed a decades long decline in oil production beginning in the 2010s.
            <br><br>
            Iraq is a dramatic example of how war causes dramatic swings in rates of oil production. Iraq’s invasion of Iran in 1980 ignited an eight year war. Fearing attacks, Iraq halted tanker shipments through the Straits of Hormuz, leading to a precipitous drop in oil production. In 1990 Iraq invaded Kuwait and targeted that country’s oil infrastructure; production plummeted in both countries.
            <br><br>
            Domestic and international politics often drive oil production. In 2018 the United States unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran nuclear deal) and imposed sanctions on imports from Iran. Oil production dropped sharply for a brief time. In Venezuela, decades of government corruption, mismanagement, underinvestment in its oil fields, and crushing international sanctions culminated in an 80 percent drop in oil production from 2015 to 2020.
